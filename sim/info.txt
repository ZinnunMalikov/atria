I will pre-construct a 2D array in Python that serves as a static hospital layout template. The grid only represents the environment, not agents.

Cell encodings:
-2 = cannot go here (walls)
-1 = spawn point
0 = free to walk
1 = patient waiting room
4 = low-severity treatment room
5 = high-severity treatment room

Nurse and doctor idle locations are not stored in the grid. Their idle positions are stored directly in their object definitions.

Patients, nurses, and doctors are all objects.

Patient object:
Each patient has a severity value in the range 1 (low) to 5 (high).

Nurse object:
Each nurse has a state (idle = 0, busy = 1).
Each nurse stores her initial idle position.
Nurses move around the grid using A* pathfinding.

Doctor object:
Each doctor has a state (idle = 0, busy = 1).
Each doctor stores his initial idle position.
Doctors move only when assigned to severe cases.

Treatment rooms are stored separately as a hashmap of integers.
Each room has:
- a severity type (low = 0, high = 1)
- an occupancy state (free = 0, occupied = 1)

Flow of the simulation:
Patients spawn every 5 ticks. Most patients are low severity, with occasional high-severity cases.
The waiting room is implemented as a MAX-heap priority queue based on patient severity.
Movement is defiend as 1-tick = 1 cell movement (up, down, left, right).

If a treatment room is free and a nurse is idle, the room is locked for the highest-priority patient in the waiting room. A nurse is dispatched to that patient.

Movement is grid-based and handled via A* pathfinding.
Escort behavior works as follows:
The nurse moves from her current position to the waiting room.
The nurse and patient then move together to the appropriate treatment room.

If the patient is not severe:
The nurse stays until treatment is complete.
After treatment, the patient walks alone to the spawn point and disappears.
A static patient count is decremented.

If the patient is severe:
The nurse escorts the patient to a severe treatment room.
The nurse then returns to her initial idle position.
One idle doctor is randomly selected and sent to the severe room.

Doctor behavior:
If doctors are idle, one is randomly chosen to handle a severe case.
If no doctor is idle, the severe patient waits in the room until one becomes available.

Discharge means the patient walks back to the spawn cell and is removed from the simulation, decrementing the static patient count.
